# Humans.txt WebExtension

This is a port of [Michael Mahemoff’s Chrome extension Humans.txt](https://github.com/mahemoff/humanstxt) ([Chrome Web Store link : Humans.txt](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pocdghmbbodjiclginddlaimdaholhfk)) to the new Firefox-compatible WebExtension format, with a couple of improvements.

## Installation :

* **Firefox Add-ons** : <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/humans-txt-webextension/>
* **Google Chrome Webstore** : <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/humanstxt-webextension/monhadhlgfjjiokfekkllknnhemfbcon>


## What it does :

> Humans.txt is an initiative for knowing the people behind a website. It's a TXT file that contains information about the different people who have contributed to building the website.

> [Humans.txt](http://humanstxt.org)

The extension displays an icon in the address bar (Firefox, Opera) or the toolbar (Google Chrome), when the domain for the website loaded in the active tab hosts a `humans.txt` file.

Users can click on the icon to see the humans.txt file.

Plain text links and Twitter handles are turned to links to facilitate navigation.
